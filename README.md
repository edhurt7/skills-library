# Skills Library

A reusable monorepo for packaging, documenting, and benchmarking skills. Packs live under `packs/` and follow the structure defined in `templates/pack-template/`.

## Pack Organization

Each pack should include:
- `skills/`: skill definitions and supporting files.
- `examples/`: minimal usage examples or sample inputs.
- `benchmark/`: benchmark inputs, outputs, and result tables.
- `tutorial/`: tutorial writeups or walkthroughs.

Use the template at `templates/pack-template/` as the starting point for new packs.
