About the job

A problem isn’t truly solved until it’s solved for all. That’s why Googlers build products that help create opportunities for everyone, whether down the street or across the globe. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you’ll use your technical expertise to lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects from start to finish. You’ll work with stakeholders to plan requirements, identify risks, manage project schedules, and communicate clearly with cross-functional partners across the company. You're equally comfortable explaining your team's analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical tradeoffs in product development with engineers.



Data Center Networks is a team of Technical Program Managers (TPgMs) and Network Implementation Engineers responsible for the delivery of data center networks in Google owned and third-party data centers.



In this role, you will manage networking projects from brand-new data center builds to expansions, NPI pilots, and even decommissioning old infrastructure. This includes overseeing the physical infrastructure deployments and proactively managing risks to keep projects on track. In parallel, you will coordinate across software teams to deploy and install the network elements into production. You will work to improve the delivery processes and efficiency, ensuring Google can deliver faster and more effectively.

Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google's product portfolio possible. We're proud to be our engineers' engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.
